# Welcome to the Cardano stablecoin payment solution.

The scope of this project is about teaching on how to build on Cardano. During the project all the learning lessons will be documented in a way other students can rebuild and learn from this project. The usecase of this project will be explained in the next chapter.

# Use case of Cardano stablecoin payment solution.

## Problem from userside
Spending money can be done in a couple different ways, but what if the user is limited in their payment options by a bank or a government? Then the online options of spending money are most of the times not possible anymore. Imagine your bank account is blocked, then how do you buy something online? Not all online stores allow you to pay afterwards with cash. To tackle this problem the user needs another issuer instead of the bank that handles the transaction. For this the user could use stablecoins to pay the business. Paying with stablecoins is like paying cash online. The only difference between cash and stablecoins is that the transaction between wallets is visible on the blockchain. (Note: visibiltiy of transactions can also be covered up later on with Midnight (issued by Cardano foundation))



## Problem from maintainer side
The business owner on this side is wanting to make more revenue. Just like every business more revenue is good for the business. By adding more payment options the users will more likely buy something from this store instead of another one. By having a crypto payment solution the business owner will be one of a few who offers this and this will ofcourse result in many crypto users coming to the businesses its website. Most of the businesses are not willing to accept cryptocurrency due to their price volatility. Therefore Coti made a stablecoin on Cardano. A stablecoin will remain a 1:1 trade-in value with a fiat currency. This makes accepting stablecoins from a blockchain network an interesting option to generate more revenue.
